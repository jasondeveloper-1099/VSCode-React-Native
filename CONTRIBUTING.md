## Development setup
We welcome any quality bugfixes or contributions!

To avoid a conflict, delete the installed extension at `~/.vscode/extensions/vsmobile.vscode-react-native`.

### Windows
* In `C:/Users/<username>/.vscode/extensions/`, `git clone` this repository

### OS X/Linux
* `git clone` this repository
* Run `ln -s <path to repo> ~/.vscode/extensions/vscode-react-native`
* You could clone it to the extensions directory if you want, but working with hidden folders in OS X can be a pain.

### Then...
* `cd` to the folder you just cloned
* Run `npm install -g gulp` and `npm install`
    * You may see an error if `bufferutil` or `utf-8-validate` fail to build. These native modules required by `ws` are optional and the debug adapter should work fine without them.
* Run `gulp build`


## Debugging
In VS Code, run the `launch as server` launch config - it will start the adapter as a server listening on port 4712. In your test app launch.json, include this flag at the top level: `"debugServer": "4712"`. Then you'll be able to debug the adapter in the first instance of VS Code, in its original TypeScript, using sourcemaps.

## Testing
There is a set of mocha tests for the debug adapter which can be run with `npm test`, and a set of mocha tests for the other functionality run as part of the `test` launch config. Also run `gulp tslint` to check your code against our tslint rules.

See the project under test/testProjcet/ for a sample project that should build and compile, allow debugging of plugins and merges, and enable intellisense for plugins.

You will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.

Please submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before submitting a pull request. You may visit https://cla.microsoft.com to sign digitally. Alternatively, download the agreement ([Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.docx](https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=typescript&DownloadId=822190) or [Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.pdf](https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=typescript&DownloadId=921298)), sign, scan, and email it back to <cla@microsoft.com>.

## Sending PR

Your pull request should:

* Include a clear description of the change
* Be a child commit of a reasonably recent commit in the **master** branch
    * Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e. no merge commits in your PR)
* It is desirable, but not necessary, for the tests to pass at each commit
* Have clear commit messages
    * e.g. "Refactor feature", "Fix issue", "Add tests for issue"
* Include adequate tests
    * At least one test should fail in the absence of your non-test code changes. If your PR does not match this criteria, please specify why
    * Tests should include reasonable permutations of the target fix/change
    * Include baseline changes with your change
* Ensure there are no linting issues ("gulp tslint")
* To avoid line ending issues, set `autocrlf = input` and `whitespace = cr-at-eol` in your git configuration

 * file and load it inside of a process.
 * On this side we listen to IPC messages and either respond to them or redirect them to packager via MultipleLifetimeAppWorker's
 * instance. We also intercept packager's signal to load the bundle's code and mutate the message with path to file we've downloaded
 * to let importScripts function take this file.

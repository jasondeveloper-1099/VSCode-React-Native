# Containerization

The extension supports [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) features on Linux.

Please follow the [VS Code official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to setup your environment to use remote development approach.

## Developing inside a Docker Container on Linux

For development of React Native Android application in Docker Container you can use [official React Native Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/reactnativecommunity/react-native-android) provided by [react-native-community](https://github.com/react-native-community/docker-android).

Here are the steps to run React Native debugging inside Docker Container on a real Android device:

1. Open Command Palette and run the following command
    ```
    Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...
    ```
    Then select `Existing Dockerfile` to create `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` configuration file.
1. Ð¡reate Dockerfile extending [reactnativecommunity/react-native-android image](https://hub.docker.com/r/reactnativecommunity/react-native-android). For example you can use the following Dockerfile:
    ```
    FROM reactnativecommunity/react-native-android:latest

    RUN npm install -g expo-cli react-native-cli
    ```

1. Configure your `devcontainer.json` file just about like this: <br> **NOTE**: This is just a sample of configuration, you can modify your `devcontainer.json` file as you need.
    ```
    {
        "name": "React Native Android Container",

        // Sets the run context to one level up instead of the .devcontainer folder.
        "context": "..",

        // Update the 'dockerFile' property if you aren't using the standard 'Dockerfile' filename.
        "dockerFile": "Dockerfile",

        // The optional 'runArgs' property can be used to specify additional runtime arguments.
        "runArgs": [
            "--privileged", // give all capabilities to a container, in other words, the container can then do almost everything that the host can do
            "--net", "host", // forwarding all host machine ports
            "-v", "/dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb" // mount connected USB devices to a container
        ],

        "settings": {
            // This will ignore your local shell user setting for Linux since shells like zsh are typically
            // not in base container images. You can also update this to an specific shell to ensure VS Code
            // uses the right one for terminals and tasks. For example, /bin/bash (or /bin/ash for Alpine).
            "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": null
        },

        // Add the IDs of extensions you want installed when the container is created in the array below.
        "extensions": ["msjsdiag.vscode-react-native"]
    }
    ```

1. Open Command Palette and run the following command `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container` to reopen your project in container
1. Connect your device via USB and start debugging the same way as on local machine

Currently the above scenario doesn't work on macOS and Windows. Docker Container implementation on these OS uses Virtual Machine tools which may have problems with USB forwarding for mobile devices.
